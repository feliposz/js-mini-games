# Javascript Mini-games

These are some small game prototypes, demos and tools, written to practice pure Javascript and learn to render graphics using HTML canvas element and WebGL.

They're just some *quick'n dirty* projects and are not particularly good examples of best programming practices, but some can be quite fun with a little tweaking and I might decide to refactor them into more structured projects.
